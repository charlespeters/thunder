# Thunder.js

Use WebP and gracefully degrade to using JPEG, GIF, or PNG


## Usage
I really like WebP. You should too. But it's not supported in all the evergreen browsers. This package detects whether the browser it's running in was WebP support and if doesn't it falls back to your specified image.

```
 <img data-thunder="path/to/img.png" src="path/to/img.webp">
```

## Installation

```
npm install thunderjs
```

```
bower install thunderjs
```
