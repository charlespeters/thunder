You should too. But it's not supported in all the evergreen browsers. This package detects whether the browser it's running in, has WebP support and if it doesn't, it falls back to your specified image.\r\n\r\n```\r\n <img data-thunder=\"path/to/img.png\" src=\"path/to/img.webp\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### NPM\r\n```\r\nnpm install thunderjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour main bundled .js file would be something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nThunder = require('thunderjs');\r\n\r\nThunder();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bower\r\n```\r\nbower install thunderjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nLink to `bower_components/thunderjs/dist/thunder.min.js` or include it in your build and then call `Thunder();`.\r\n\r\n## Advantages of WebP\r\n\r\n- [25% to 34% smaller files](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_study)\r\n- Transparency\r\n- Lossless Quality\r\n\r\nHere's one really awesome [use case](http://product.voxmedia.com/2015/8/13/9143805/performance-update-2-electric-boogaloo\r\n) that boosted performance.\r\n\r\n## Generating WebP Images\r\n\r\n[WebP's Getting Started Guide](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/using) has lots of details about getting started with WebP and CLI tools, be sure to check that out.\r\n\r\n### Sketch\r\n\r\nAt this moment, I know of no tool that will allow you to export webP images from Bohemian Coding's Sketch app. But if you know of one please submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Online Converters\r\n\r\n- [Online Convert](http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp)\r\n- [WebP Converter](http://webp-converter.com/)\r\n- [Convertio](https://convertio.co/convert-to-webp/)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nFirst off, you're awesome for wanting to contribute. Second, please take a second to go over a few things to make this process simpler for everyone. Third, you're awesome.\r\n\r\n### Pull Requests\r\n- [Fork](https://github.com/charlespeters/thunder#fork-destination-box) this repo.\r\n- Push to your fork and submit a pull request.\r\n- Please provide a short explanation of why you made the changes you made.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n**Reduced test cases are required**. All bug reports and problem issues require a reduced test case. See [CSS Tricks - Reduced Test Cases](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) on why they _\"are the absolute, ... number one way to troubleshoot bugs.\"_ Reduced test cases help you identify the issue at hand and understand your own code. On our side, they greatly reduce the amount of time spent resolving the issue.\r\n\r\n- A reduced test case is an isolated example that demonstrates the bug or issue.\r\n- It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug. No extra functionality or styling.\r\n- A link to your site is **not** a reduced test case.\r\n- A [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/) or [CodePen](http://codepen.io) is preferred so we can help you fix an error.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
